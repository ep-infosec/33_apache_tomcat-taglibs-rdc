    <p>
        JSP 2.0  Reusable Dialog Components (RDC) is a framework for
        creating JSP taglibs that aid in rapid development of voice and
        multimodal applications.
    </p>
    <p>
        The building blocks are atomic RDCs, which collect a single piece of
        user information. Examples are <b>&lt;rdc:date&gt;</b> or <b>&lt;rdc:isbn&gt;</b>.
        Composite RDCs may collect multiple pieces of user information. This
        is usually done by leveraging the functionality of existing RDCs.
        A composite has its own data model, and makes the collected pieces
        of information available in a structured form to the application.
        An example of a composite RDC is <b>&lt;rdc:dateRange&gt;</b>.
        Within the RDC framework, a component is a generic term, referring to
        either an atomic RDC or a composite RDC. Finally, a container is a
        helper tag used to aggregate multiple RDCs into a single coherent
        unit with respect to the task at hand and the associated dialog. It
        also defines the dialog management strategy. The most commonly used
        container is <b>&lt;rdc:group&gt;</b>. Various group dialog management
        strategies are supported and additional ones can be plugged in.
        A simple directed dialog, a rule-based strategy and an SCXML-based one
        are available.
